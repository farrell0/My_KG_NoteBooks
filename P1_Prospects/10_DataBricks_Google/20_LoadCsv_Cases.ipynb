This optimizes the chance of controlling tumor while diminishing the acute and long-term side effects. With conformal 3-dimensional simulation, there is extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist effort and time expended. The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room where appropriate markers are placed and the patient is positioned and immobilized. Preliminary filed sizes and arrangements, including gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields are conceived. Radiographs are taken and these films are approved by the physician. Appropriate marks are placed on the patient's skin or on the immobilization device.\\n\\nThe patient is transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table. Scans are performed through the targeted area. The scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on the CT images. The dosimetrist then evaluates the slices in the treatment-planning computer with appropriately marked structures. This volume is reconstructed in a virtual 3-dimensional space utilizing the beam's-eye view features. Appropriate blocks are designed. Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume. Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide coverage of the target volume while minimizing dose to normal structures.\\n\\nOnce appropriate beam parameters and isodose distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, the individual slices are then reviewed by the physician. The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician. Once these are approved, physical blocks or multi-leaf collimator equivalents will be devised. If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where computer designed fields are re-simulated.\\n\\nIn view of the extensive effort and time expenditure required, this procedure justifies the special procedure code, 77470.\")\n",

He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.\\n\\nWithin the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion. The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent. It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective. Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.\\n\\nAfter seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen. They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks. They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.\\n\\nFrom my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him. This is very worrisome. Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well. Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor. It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.\\n\\nEmphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation. Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible. It is not that he does not want treatment, however. Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen. We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days. In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day. If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us. At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.\\n\\nWhile I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval. In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later. I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.\\n\\nI will keep you apprised of followups. If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.\\n\\nSincerely,')\n",

Upon evaluation, it was noted that the patient has draining bilateral masses with the left mass being approximately 8 cm in diameter upon palpation and the right being approximately 4 cm in diameter. The patient had been continued on antibiotics preoperatively. The patient with history of Hodgkin's lymphoma approximately 18 years ago and underwent therapy at that time and he was declared free of disease since that time. Consent for possible recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma warranted exploration and excision of these masses. The patient was explained the risks and benefits of the procedure and informed consent was obtained.\\n\\nGROSS FINDINGS: Upon dissection of the left axillary mass, the mass was removed in toto and noted to have a cavity within it consistent with an abscess.\\n\\nNo loose structures were identified and sent for frozen section, which upon intraoperative consultation with Pathology Department revealed no obvious evidence of lymphoma, however, the confirmed pathology report is pending at this time. The right axillary mass was excised without difficulty without requiring full axillary dissection.\\n\\nPROCEDURE: The patient was placed in supine position after appropriate anesthesia was obtained and a sterile prep and drape complete. A #10 blade scalpel was used to make an elliptical incision about the mass itself extending this incision further to aid in the mobilization of the mass. Sharp dissection was utilized with Metzenbaum scissors about the mass to maintain the injury to the skin structure and upon showing out the mass, Bovie electrocautery was utilized adjacent to the wall structure to maintain hemostasis. Identification of the axillary anatomy was made and care was made to avoid injury to nerve, vessel or musculature. Once this mass was removed in toto, lymph node structures were as well delivered with this mass and sent to frozen section as well the specimen was sent to gram stain and culture. Upon revaluation of the incisional site, it was noted to be hemostatic. Warm lap sponge was then left in place at this site. Next, attention was turned to the right axilla where a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a 4 cm incision about the mass including the cutaneous structures involved with the erythematous reaction. This was as well removed in toto and sent to Pathology for gram stain and culture as well as pathologic evaluation. This site was then made hemostatic as well with the aid of Bovie electrocautery and approximation of the deep dermal tissues after irrigation with warm saline was then done with #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by #4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips were applied. Attention was returned back left axilla, which upon re-exploration was noted to be hemostatic and a #7 mm JP was then introduced making a skin stab inferior to the incision and bringing the end of the drain through this incision. This was placed within the incision site, ________ drainage of the axillary potential space. Approximation of the deep dermal tissues were then done with #3-0 Vicryl in an interrupted technique followed by #4-0 Vicryl with running subcuticular technique. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. JP bulb was then placed to suction and sterile dressings were applied to both axilla.

Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis. Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound. She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm. She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct. She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP. On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma. A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture.

She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed. She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well. She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms. As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup.

At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy. Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks. She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007. She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y. Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.\\n\\nOn colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure.

Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.\\n\\nStaging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs. The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1. The ovaries were normal. An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She has otherwise been feeling well. She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy. She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber.

A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week. She does not smoke now. She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine. She is married and has no children. An IUD was recently placed. She works as an esthetician.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: Father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45. This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history. She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early.

She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled. Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.\\n\\nA lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis. Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy. I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age. Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit. Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.\\n\\nPlan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects. We did not review all that information today.\\n\\nShe has a family history of early colon cancer. Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can. Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available. She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy. She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission. I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed.

The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room, where appropriate markers are placed, and the patient is positioned and immobilized. One then approximates the field sizes and arrangements (gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields). Radiographs are taken, and these fields are marked on the patient's skin. The patient is then transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table. Scans are then performed through the targeted area. The CT scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist, and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on each slice of the CT scan. The dosimetrist then evaluates each individual slice in the treatment planning computer with the appropriately marked structures. This volume is then reconstructed in 3-dimensional space. Utilizing the beam's-eye view features, the appropriate blocks are designed. Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume. Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide homogenous coverage of the target volume while minimizing the dose to normal structures. Once all appropriate beam parameters and isodate distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, each individual slice is then reviewed by the physician. The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician. Once these are approved, Cerrobend blocks will be custom fabricated.\\nIf significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where the computer-designed fields are re-simulated.\")\n",

Her history dated back to March 2005 when she first sought medical attention for evidence of pericarditis, which was treated with pericardial window in an outside hospital, at that time she was also found to have mesenteric pain and thrombosis, is now anticoagulated. Her pericardial fluid was accumulated and she was seen by Dr. Y. At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was performed by Dr. Z. Review of her CT scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy, already shows bilateral plural effusions. The patient improved clinically after the pericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms. Recently, she was readmitted to the hospital with chest pain and found to have bilateral pleural effusion, the right greater than the left. CT of the chest also revealed a large mediastinal lymph node. We reviewed the pathology obtained from the pericardectomy in March 2006, which was diagnostic of mesothelioma. At this time, chest tube placement for drainage of the fluid occurred and thoracoscopy with fluid biopsies, which were performed, which revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma. The patient was then stained with a PET CT, which showed extensive uptake in the chest, bilateral pleural pericardial effusions, and lymphadenopathy. She also had acidic fluid, pectoral and intramammary lymph nodes and uptake in L4 with SUV of 4. This was consistent with stage III disease. Her repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% to 49%. She was transferred to Oncology service and started on chemotherapy on September 1, 2007 with cisplatin 75 mg/centimeter squared equaling 109 mg IV piggyback over 2 hours on September 1, 2007, Alimta 500 mg/ centimeter squared equaling 730 mg IV piggyback over 10 minutes.

She comes into clinic today accompanied by her daughters to review the results.\\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Levothyroxine 88 mcg daily, Soriatane 25 mg daily, Timoptic 0.5% solution b.i.d., Vicodin 5/500 mg one to two tablets q.6 hours p.r.n.\\n\\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient continues to have back pain some time she also take two pain pill. She received platelet transfusion the other day and reported mild fever. She denies any chills, night sweats, chest pain, or shortness of breath. The rest of her review of systems is negative.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\\nVITALS: BP: 118/60. HEART RATE: 76. TEMP: 97.8. Weight: 65.5 kg.\\nGEN: She looks well, in no acute distress.\\nHEENT: Her pupils were noted for surgical changes bilaterally. Oropharynx is clear.\\nNECK: Supple. She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.\\nLUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nCV: Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs.\\nABDOMEN: Soft. He has positive bowel sounds.\\nEXT: Lower extremities are without edema.\\n\\nIMAGING: Her CT scan shows a pleural base mass in the left apex appears to have some growth along the medial margin comparing with PET/CT assessment 07/08/10. While this extends to the pleural surface it does not clearly invade directly into the chest wall or the adjacent posterior lateral left third rib. Left suprahilar and mediastinal adenopathy appears to be essentially stable since 07/08/10. Multilevel thoracic bony metastatic disease is present. Hypodense liver metastasis appears slightly improved comparing with July, more substantially improved comparing with chest CT of 04/21/10.\\n\\nASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a very pleasant female 67-year-old female with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. She had one treatment postponed due to counts. She had low blood counts this week requiring platelet transfusion, so we are going to dose reduce for six treatments by 10%. As far as the back pain, she clearly has evidence of progressive bone metastasis in T3, T11, T12, and T1 and questions about the soft tissue mass pleural base mass in the lateral left apex. I am going to refer back to Dr. X to see if there might be some palliative radiation to deal with the left back and scapular region.')\n",

The procedure, purpose, risk, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with her and she was agreeable to surgery.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE: Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, her left chest, neck, axilla, and arm were prepped with Betadine solution, draped in a sterile fashion. An incision was made at the hairline, carried down by sharp dissection through the clavipectoral fascia. I was able to easily palpate the lymph node and grasp it with a figure-of-eight 2-0 silk suture and by sharp dissection, was carried to hemoclip all attached structures. The lymph node was excised in its entirety. The wound was irrigated. The lymph node sent to pathology. The wound was then closed.

The left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since. In early November, he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg, which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain. Physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved. In December, he noted onset of increasing fatigue. He used to work out regularly, lifting lifts, doing abdominal exercises, and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities. He has lost 10 pounds since December and feels his appetite has decreased. Night sweats and cough began in December, for which he was treated with a course of Augmentin. However, both of these problems have continued. He also began taking Accutane for persistent acne in December (this agent was stopped on 02/19/2007).

He was seen in Emergency Room where it was noted that he had an elevated WBC of 18,000. CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to rule out possible appendicitis and on that CT, a large clot in the inferior vena cava extending to the right iliac and femoral veins was found. He promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis. Repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued. Because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected. Appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a PET/CT scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation. This study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity. Because the WBC continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, Sheryl Asplund, M.D., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood. These studies became available the afternoon of 02/23/2007, and confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

He was presented at Tumor Board where it was thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma. Thus, he was offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm. He was explained the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure. He wished to proceed, so he was brought to the operating room.\\n\\nAn epidural catheter was placed. He was put in a supine position where SCDs and Foley catheter were placed. He was put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube. He was given preoperative antibiotics, then he was placed in the left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.\\n\\nA low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace was made using the skin knife and then Bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the Alexander instrument, the chest was entered. Upon entering the chest, the chest wall retractor was inserted and the cavity inspected. It appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and was involving the diaphragm. He also had some marked lymphadenopathy. With these findings, which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma, we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection. Thus, we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly. We also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the arteries going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar arteries as well as the artery going to the right middle lobe. The posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a GIA stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 2-0 ties. Once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy, we were able to pass a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment. This was ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 3-0 silk. This was divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe. This was also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated. Care was taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobe.\\n\\nWe then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein. The superior pulmonary vein was visualized as well. The right angle was passed around the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was ligated in continuity with 2-0 silk and a 3-0 stick tie. Upon division of this portion, the specimen site had some bleeding, which was eventually controlled using several 3-0 silk sutures. The bronchial anatomy was defined. Next, we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe as well as the right middle lobe. A TA-30 4.8 stapler was then closed. The lung insufflated. The right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well. The stapler was fired, and the bronchus was cut with a 10-blade.\\n\\nWe then turned our attention to the diaphragm. There was a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm has involved with tumor, and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin. Upon going through the diaphragm, it became clear that the tumor was also involving the dome of the liver, so after going around the diaphragm in its entirety, we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that was involved. It seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion. The Bovie was set to high cautery. The capsule was entered, and then using Bovie cautery, we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver. It did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver. Hemostasis was achieved with Bovie cautery and gentle pressure. The specimen was then taken off the table and sent to Pathology for permanent. The area was inspected for hemostasis. A 10-flat JP was placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection, and 0 Prolene was used to close the diaphragmatic defect, which was under very little tension. A single 32 straight chest tube was also placed. The lung was seen to expand. We also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobes would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe. Hemostasis was observed at the end of the case. The chest tube was irrigated with sterile water, and there was no air leak observed from the bronchial stump. The chest was then closed with Vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscles, staying above the ribs. The 2-0 Vicryl was used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer, and 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin. The patient was then brought to supine position, extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.\\n\\nDr. X was present for the entirety of the procedure, which was a right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and a portion of liver.')\n",

She specifically denied any fevers or chills. However, she was complaining of chest pain. She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough. When she did cough, it was nonproductive. While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations. An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes. The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate. A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe. The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism. Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.

Preoperative antibiotic was given and Dr. X proceeded to intubate the patient after a detailed anesthetic preparation that started in the Same Day Surgery and followed in the operating room. Finally, a 5.5-French endotracheal tube was inserted and the patient was able to tolerate that and did have stable vital signs and a proper oxygenation.\\n\\nThen, the patient was positioned with the neck slightly distended and turned toward the opposite side of the operation. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. I proceeded to mark the site of the mass and then also to mark the proposed site for the creation of a flap. Then, I performed an extensive anesthetic block of the area.\\n\\nThen, an incision was made along the area marked for development of the flap, but in a very limited extent, just to expose the cervical mass. The cervical mass, which was about 4 cm in diameter and very firm and rubbery, was found lodged between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein in the area III of the neck. A wedge sample was sent to Pathology for frozen section. At the same time, we waited for the result and the initial report was not clear in the sense that a lot of lymphoepithelial reaction was seen. Therefore, a larger sample was sent to Pathology and at that particular time, the fresh frozen was reported as having squamous elements. This was not totally clear in my mind and therefore I proceeded to excise the full mass, which luckily was not attached to any structures except in the very deep surface. There, there were some attachments to branches of the external carotid artery, which had to be suture ligated. At any rate, the whole specimen was to the lab and finally the diagnosis was that of a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.\\n\\nWith that information in hand, we proceeded to continue with a neck dissection and proceeded to make an incision along the previously marked sites of the flap, which basically involved a reverse U shape on the left neck. This worked out quite nicely. The external jugular vein was out of the way, so initially we did not deal with it. We proceeded to tackle the area III and extended into II-A. When we excised the mass, the upper end was in intimate relationship with the parotid gland, which was relatively large in this patient, but it looked normal otherwise. Also, I felt that the submaxillary gland was enlarged. At any rate, we decided to clean up the areas III and IV and a few nodes from II-A that were removed, and then we went into the posterior triangle where we identified the spinal accessory nerve, which we protected, actually did not even dissect close to it.\\n\\nThe same nerve had been already identified anterior to the internal jugular vein, very proximally behind the digastric and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. At any rate, there were large nodes in the posterior triangle, in areas V-A and V-B, which were excised and sent to Pathology for examination. Also, there was a remnant of a capsule of the main mass that we proceeded to excise and sent to Pathology as an extra specimen. Hemostasis was revised and found to be adequate. The flaps had been protected by folding it to the chest and protected by wet sponges on both sides of the flap. The flap was replaced in its position. A soft Jackson-Pratt catheter was left in the area, and then we proceeded to approximate the flap with a number of subcutaneous sutures of Vicryl and then running sutures of subcuticular Monocryl to the skin. I would like to mention that also the facial vein was excised and the external jugular vein was ligated. It was in very lateral location and it was on the site of the drain, so we ligated that but did not excise it. A pressure dressing was applied.\\n\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was no more than 100 mL. The patient was extubated in the operating room and sent for recovery.')\n",

We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.\\n\\nABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain. Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened. Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room. A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease. At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation. On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes. The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum. This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery. There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region. There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm. There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease. There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base. There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing. There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax. In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor. All other structures appeared normal. On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed. Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.\\n\\nOn further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite. He has not ever had a chronic smoker's cough and still does not have a cough. He has no sputum production or hemoptysis.

She was begun on Aricept but could not tolerate that because of strange thoughts and hallucinations. She was found to be hypercalcemic. Intact PTH was mildly elevated. A sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound showed evidence of a right superior parathyroid adenoma.\\n\\nFINDINGS AND PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position. A time out was taken so that the anesthesia personnel, nursing personnel, surgical team, and patient could confirm the patient\\'s identity, operative site and operative plan. The electronic medical record was reviewed as was the ultrasound. The patient was sedated. A small roll was placed behind the shoulders to moderately hyperextend the neck. The head was supported in a foam head cradle. The neck and chest were prepped with chlorhexidine and isolated with sterile drapes. After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine along the planned incision, a transverse incision was made in the skin crease a couple of centimeters above the clavicular heads and carried down through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma. The larger anterior neck veins were divided between 4-0 silk ligatures. Superior and inferior flaps were developed in the subplatysmal plane using electrocautery and blunt dissection. The sternohyoid muscles were separated in the midline, and the right sternohyoid muscle was retracted laterally. The right sternothyroid muscle was divided transversely with the cautery. The right middle thyroid vein was divided between 4-0 silk ligatures. The right thyroid lobe was rotated leftward. Posterior to the mid portion of the left thyroid lobe, a right superior parathyroid adenoma of moderate size was identified. This was freed up and its pedicle was ligated with small Hemoclips and divided and the gland was removed. It was sent for weight and frozen section. It weighed 960 mg and on frozen section was consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.\\n\\nPrior to the procedure, a peripheral blood sample had been obtained and placed in a purple top tube labeled pre-excision.\" It was our intention to monitor intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone 10 minutes after removal of this parathyroid adenoma. However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma was high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH. The neck was irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory. The sternohyoid muscles were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl. The platysma was closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.

The patient was thereafter prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using Betadine Scrub and Betadine paint. Thereafter, the local anesthesia was injected into the area around the tumor. A **** type excision was planned down to the periosteum. A supraperiosteal radical resection was performed.\\n\\nIt was obvious that there was tumor at the deep margin, involving the periosteum. The edges were marked along the four quadrants, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and the 9 o'clock positions, and these were sent for frozen section evaluation. Frozen section revealed positive margins at one end of the resection. Therefore, an additional circumferential resection was performed and the final margins were all negative.\\nFollowing completion, the deep periosteal margin was resected. The circumferential periosteal margins were noted to be negative; however, centrally, there was a small area which showed tumor eroding into the superficial cortex of the skull. Therefore, the Midas Rex drill was utilized to resect approximately 1-2 mm of the superficial cortex of the bone at the area where the positive margin was located. Healthy bone was obtained; however, it did not enter the diploic or marrow-containing bone in the area. Therefore, no bong margin was taken. However, at the end of the procedure, it did not appear that the residual bone had any residual changes consistent with carcinoma.\\n\\nFollowing completion of the bony resection, the area was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.

The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size. The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past. The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.\\n\\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap. Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.\\n\\nThe foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses. The foot was lowered to the operating table. The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux. The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone. The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx. There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx. The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer. Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen. At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx. The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues. Any suspicious tissue was removed. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.\\n\\nAttention was then directed to the left second toe. There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe. A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass. The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule. This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance. It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon. Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed. The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology. Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC.\")\n",

The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004. An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed. When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there. The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction. She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism. There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family. She has no notable discomfort with this lesion. There have been no skin changes.

This was done in Tijuana. His mom is from central portion of Mexico. There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a junior at Hoover High School. She lives with her mom in Fresno.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\nGENERAL: The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress. She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.\\nHEENT: The head and neck examination is most significant. There is mild amount of facial acne. The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.\\nNECK: There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus. A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid. This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine. There are some shotty adenopathy in the area. No supraclavicular nodes were noted.\\nCHEST: Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.\\nLUNGS: Clear.\\nCARDIOVASCULAR: Normal. There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.\\nABDOMEN: Benign.\\nEXTREMITIES: Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.\\nGENITOURINARY: External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.

There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.\\n\\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range. T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal. Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative. There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this. A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable. A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed. There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.\\n\\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary. The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease. I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease. During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy. We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation. We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well. I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them. I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit. This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy. The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case. I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity. All of the family's questions have been answered. This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family. I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done. We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.\")\n",
