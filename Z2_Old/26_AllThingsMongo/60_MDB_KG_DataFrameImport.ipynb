    "Presumably, MongoDB is acting as the system of record, for operational data, and you wish to import that data into KatanaGraph,\n",
    "where you can perform; graph queries, graph analytics, graph machine learning and mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing data into KatanaGraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "All told, there are several means to (get data into) Katanagraph, as well as affect data that is already present. These include: \n",
    "importing, manpiulating, and mutating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a full treatment on all of (importing, manipulating, and mutating) data into and inside KatanaGraph, see [Here](https://www/google.com).\n",
    "- Here we detail importing data from MongoDB into KatanaGraph using Python Pandas/Dask DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "To source data from MongoDB, we use the standard MongoDB driver for Python titled, PyMongo.\n",
    "There is the Dask MongoDB project on GitHub, [Here](https://github.com/coiled/dask-mongo), which we chose not to use. While this project offers\n",
    "increased parallelism, the functional query capabilities are much reduced over Pymongo.\n",

    "## In this section, the following assumptions are made:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  You have a functional Katanagraph cluster that you can authenticate against, with at least 3 worker nodes. See [Here](https://www/google.com).\n",
    "-  You have a functional MongoDB database server that you can authenticate against. For the example presented below, the MongoDB system is available\n",
    "   at **localhost, and port 7777**. (The steps presented also work for remotely accessed MongoDB systems.) \n",
    "-  For this example, we use the common MongoDB demonstration database titled, **mFlix (Sample_mFlix).** \n",
    "<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Documentation on this MongoDB sample data set available [Here]( https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/).\n",

    "                   MongoDB being a document database, and KatanaGraph being a graph platform.\n",
    "<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -  From the MongoDB mFlix demonstration database, we use the collections titled; Users, Movies, and Comments. \n",
