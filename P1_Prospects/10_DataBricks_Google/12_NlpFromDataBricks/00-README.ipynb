It offers resources primarily in the form of transcribed sample medical reports across medical specialties and common medical transcription words/phrases encountered in specific sections that form part of a medical report  – sections such as physical examination or PE, review of systems or ROS, laboratory data and mental status exam, among others. \n\nWe chose 50 de-identified oncology reports from the MT Oncology notes dataset as the source of the unstructured text and landed the raw text data into the Delta Lake bronze layer. For demonstration purposes, we limited the number of samples to 50, but the framework presented in this solution accelerator can be scaled to accommodate millions of clinical notes and text files. \n\nThe first step in our accelerator is to extract variables using various models for [Named-Entity Recognition (NER)](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/named-entity-recognition-ner-with-bert-in-spark-nlp/). To do that, we first set up our NLP pipeline, which contains [annotators](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/annotators) such as [documentAssembler](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/annotators#documentassembler) and [sentenceDetector](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/annotators#sentencedetector) and [tokenizer](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/annotators#tokenizer)  that are trained specifically for healthcare-related NER. \n<br>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/master/databricks/solution_accelerators/images/dbr_flow.png\" width=65%>\n\nWe then create dataframes of extracted entitities and land the tables in Delta where can be accessed for interactive analysis or dashboarding using [databricks SQL](https://databricks.com/product/databricks-sql). \n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/master/databricks/solution_accelerators/images/insights_from_oncology_repots.png\" width=65%>\n\n## Data\n\n[MT ONCOLOGY NOTES](https://www.mtsamplereports.com/) comprises of millions of ehr records of patients. It contains semi-structured data like demographics, insurance details, and a lot more, but most importantly, it also contains free-text data like real encounters and notes.\n\n## Solution Overview\nHere we show how to use Spark NLP's existing models to process raw text and extract highly specialized cancer information that can be used for various downstream use cases, including:\n- Staff demand analysis according to specialties.\n- Preparing reimbursement-ready data with billable codes.\n- Analysis of risk factors of patients and symptoms.\n- Analysis of cancer disease and symptoms.\n- Drug usage analysis for inventory management.\n- Preparing timeline of procedures.\n- Relations between internal body part and procedures.\n- Analysis of procedures used on oncological events.\n- Checking assertion status of oncological findings."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"59d196cd-1757-4165-90ae-8ce1d7863d2a","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Notebooks\nThere are three notebooks in this package:\n\n1. `config`: Notebook for configuring the environment\n2. `entity-extraction`: Extract drugs, oncological entitities, assertion status and relationships and writes the data into Delta lake.\n3. `oncology-analytics`: Interactive analysis of the data."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"8828e2a2-7c8f-4533-ba6f-373f3fa54a5c","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Setup\nIf you are new to Databricks, create an account at: https://databricks.com/try-databricks\n### Turnkey John Snow Labs installation\n\nComplete John Snow Labs onboarding form at: www.JohnSnowLabs.com/Databricks and speficy `Name`, `email`, `Databricks instance URL` and [access token](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/authentication.html#authentication-using-databricks-personal-access-tokens).
